What is Observability?
Observability is a proactive approach to understanding the health and performance of the systems in real-time. It is the ability to understand what is happening within a system by analyzing data collected from logs, metrics, and traces. These three pillars of observability provide unique, complementary insights:

 * Logs: Logs capture event-based data, recording errors, warnings, and other critical details.

 * Metrics: Metrics track quantitative data over time, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and request rates.

 * Traces: Traces follow a requestâ€™s journey across distributed systems, identifying bottlenecks and delays.

Combined, these data sources give IT teams a comprehensive view of system performance and health, allowing them to detect, troubleshoot, and resolve issues proactively.

OpenTelemetry:
OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework designed to enable observability in software systems. It provides a set of tools, APIs, and SDKs to collect, process, and export telemetry data, such as traces, metrics, and logs, from applications and infrastructure. The goal of OpenTelemetry is to make it easier to monitor and troubleshoot complex systems, especially those built with microservices, distributed systems, or cloud-native architectures.
